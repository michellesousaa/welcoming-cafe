Complete Tier- Claude Web
 ## 1. What did you build?
 I made an interactive filter menu for the menu page of my Welcoming Cafe website. This allows users to view only the items in a certain category, such as Coffee, Signature, Tea, Pastries, or Light Fare.
## 2. How did micro-iteration feel?
Micro-iteration was easier to understand what was going on when we broke down the feature into small steps. Rather than asking the AI to make all of the changes at once, we worked on one small step at a time and then moved on to the next thing. This allowed me to understand what was being added to my project.
## 3. What did self-review catch?
When I asked the AI to review its own code, it caught a bug in the modal design. The modal was missing a max-height property, which caused it to extend past the boundaries of the screen. 
## 4. Tool impressions.
 I’ve always enjoyed Claude because it’s quick and easy to understand. Using it in the terminal was even better because it could operate right within my project directory without having to copy and paste everything manually.
## 5. Self-review patterns.
 At first, the AI wasn’t picking up much, but by step 4, it began to pick up layout and usability issues. I didn’t personally pick up anything it missed, although if I were to look closer, I’m sure I could find some tiny fixes.
## 6. Browser tool vs. CLI comparison.
 The CLI is way better because it could operate right within my project files. Browser tools are nice, but the terminal is just more efficient. 
## 7. When would you use micro-iteration + self-review?
I would use this process for larger features or if I wanted to understand the process completely. I would likely not use it for smaller or simpler updates that don’t involve much logic.
